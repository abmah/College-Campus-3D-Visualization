<h1>Three.js College Project</h1>
<p>This is a college project created using <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_new">Three.js</a>, <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_new">Blender</a>, <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/" target="_new">Chart.js</a>, <a href="https://greensock.com/gsap/" target="_new">GSAP library</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui" target="_new">dat.GUI</a>. The project involves creating a 3D model of a college using Blender, baking textures, and importing the model into Three.js.</p>
<p>The pointer lock controls allow the user to experience a first-person view of the college and walk around the campus. In addition, Chart.js and raycasting are used to display interactive data above the buildings. The data includes the female-to-male ratio and student year distribution.</p>
<p>The GSAP library is used to add animation effects to the UI components, and dat.GUI provides controls for tweaking the settings of the application.</p>
<h2>How to Run</h2>
