Three.js College Project
This is a college project created using Three.js, Blender, Chart.js, GSAP library, and dat.GUI. The project involves creating a 3D model of a college using Blender, baking textures, and importing the model into Three.js.

The pointer lock controls allow the user to experience a first-person view of the college and walk around the campus. In addition, Chart.js and raycasting are used to display interactive data above the buildings. The data includes the female-to-male ratio and student year distribution.

The GSAP library is used to add animation effects to the UI components, and dat.GUI provides controls for tweaking the settings of the application.

How to Run
To run the project, simply open the index.html file in a web browser that supports WebGL. You can use the pointer lock controls to navigate through the campus and interact with the data visualizations.
